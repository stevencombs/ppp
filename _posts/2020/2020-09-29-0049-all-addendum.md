## Addendum (The main topic!)

A lot of items and a lot of links in the show notes below:

1. Sad Note: We lost my daughter back to the iPhone eco-system.
2. Happy Note: My 80+ old mother is using a [Pixel 3a - $350](https://amzn.to/30ilmyN) to replace her five year-old Samsung and is now using Google Fi instead of Boost mobile.
3. Android: Version 11 released and there's really not much to talk about, but we talk about the changes in an upcoming episode.
4. Android Auto: Nice little tweak now shows song titles in the control bar when switching tracks so you don't have to switch back to music application.
5. Chrome Browser: Adds tab grouping and tab preview
6. Chrome OS: Google delays Chrome Apps' deprecation by two more years
7. Chrome OS: ChromeOS.dev new developer hug is <https://chromeos.dev> and it is packed with info on not only Chrome OS, but Android and Linux development on Chrome OS.
8. Chrome OS: Now has a Print Jobs application. Search for it in the launcher the next time you have print issues.
9. Chrome OS: Files app now includes a recent section to find those files you used yesterday (or any other previous day) quickly.
10. Google Assistant: Come to new [Fitbit Versa 3](https://amzn.to/2Gp99ko) and [Sense](https://amzn.to/2Gp9bsw). Still waiting on the merger and a Pixel Watch but for now will stick to my TicWatch, more later.
11. Google Assistant: "Hey Assistant, show me my day" to view a daily snapshot and while you're there, create a shortcut for the homescreen. Previously you had to select this view by touch.
12. [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com): Soon to automatically delete trashed files after 30 days
13. Google Home: Google Home adds networking features from the Google Wifi app
14. Google One: More to the app/program than you thought. You can now upload Canon photos from your camera directly to Google Photos using the horribly rated [image.canon android app])https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=image.canon). I have a [Canon EOS M50](https://amzn.to/3cGeb8o) and Google One account but have yet to try this out. Let me know if you have.
15. Perks: [Project Highrise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kalypsomedia.projecthighrise) and [The House of Davinci](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluebraingames.thehouseofdavinci) now available. Visit <https://www.google.com/chromebook/perks/> to see if your device qualifies.
16. [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds): Now appear in the Find My Device so you can keep track of them and includes location of last connection.
17. [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds): You can now get them in colors; white, orange, mint, and black.
18. [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds): They evidently can survive the washing machine, but not after some strange behavior as they dry out!
19. [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds): First feature drop adds bass boost, attention alerts, and disabling touch controls. Later firmware update attempts to correct drop-out issues which I'm still not seeing with my Pixel 4XL. Listen to my [Pixel Buds episode](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com/0048/).
20. Google Meet: Available on Chromecast and uses camera, microphone from your computer. Some reporting this works with Zoom.
21. [Google Podcasts](podcasts.google.com): Finally shows your subscriptions on the web. Still not full fledge web app, but getting there.
22. Google Assistant: Use "Hey Assistant, Remember {this thing}" and "Hey Assistant, Open Memory."
23. Google Assistant: Stop an alarm or timer from any room with "Hey Assistant, stop the timer in the {name of room}."
24. [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com): Lyrics now rolling out to My Playing Screen.
25. [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com): Collaborative playlists that use AI and your friends to build the perfect playlist. Perfect for roadtrips and gatherings.
26. [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/subscriptions/pro): Now has pro version with name your price for life until the first week of October with a minimum price of $1.99 per month. I have it a shot and will let you know how it goes with "some seriously powerful tools, like queries and filter code."
27. Waze: Now with Batman's Voice (or rather Kevin Conroy).
28. Wear OS: [Mobvoi's new TicWatch GTX - $60](https://amzn.to/3cJ1lX1)

31. Wyze Cam: [Outdoor Cam](https://wyze.com/wyze-cam-outdoor.html) in action and you can see the setup on [my YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iMRspt-YkDw)
32. Google Event: New Pixel 5, Google Hub speakers, and Google TV (combines Android TV and Chromecast) on September 30th at 11 a.m. eastern (you may have already heard by the time you listen to this episode).

That's it for now. In the next episodes I'm going to talk about the Google Event product releases, Android 11, and we will take a deep dive into Wear OS. Until then, send feedback using info below and I've started reposting to the podcast archives. Only 8 more episodes to go before all episodes have been transferred to the new site.
