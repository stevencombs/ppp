Over [on my blog](https://www.stevencombs.com), I have [a post](https://www.stevencombs.com/gadgets/2020/04/05/wyzecam-to-webcam.html) about the new webcam firmware for Wyze Cams. This firmware was released to help with the shortage of webcams available for those working from home in light of COVID-19. Instead of waiting for Logitech's, or other webcam providers', stock to replenish, those with a [$25 Wyze Cam](https://amzn.to/2R2sgn6) can now download the firmware, update their security camera device, and use it as a webcam on their personal computer.

My blog post, and the [accompanying YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft5GLFBIPNw), includes directions for installing the firmware and my performance test of the converted webcam on both Mac and Linux (Elementary OS) operating systems. Why I didn't test on Chrome OS was a question by some listeners that even surprised me! The next day, I got to work. I pulled out my Pixel Slate and ran a test of the webcam on Chrome OS. The video below shows the results of my tests.

While I did share these video results on my personal blog, I thought it important to share here for listeners who may want to give this a shot themselves. You will notice from the video that performance is spotty at best for the microphone; however, video and speaker functionality work well. Knowing this, you may find a use case for these inexpensive camera's with your Pixel device. 

If you do use a Wyze Cam as a webcam, remember to select the Pixel devices built-in microphone instead of the Wyze Cams internal microphone. Especially on the Slate since it has some of the best microphones of any Pixel device. You can do this in *Settings* or selecting the input/output options button to the right of the volume controls in the *Launcher* settings.

Let me know if you give this a try. I'd love to hear your feedback. And how can you provide that feedback? Look no further than the information below:
