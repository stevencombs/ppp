There are thousands of applications available on the Chrome Web and Google Play stores. There are also thousands of applications available as a web page or service. What if you combined the two? Well, then you would have a progressive web application, or PWA. In this episode, Iwe take a look at the best PWAs for Chrome OS and Android (since they work on either device).

## Feedback

Feedback from past episodes includes:

1. Rick asked to up the volume on the podcast. Working on it and hopefully this episode is better. Now he can blast the episode as he drive topless (his car) down the road.
2. Redditor, texbiker, shared that he is using Zwift for indoor biking to help him through the COVID-19 and is also the recipient of a new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook. He's having good experiences so far. Check out his comments on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelpowerpodcast/comments/fzkdit/httpswwwpixelpowerpodcastcom0045/).

## Progressive Web Applications for Chrome OS

### History

1. Remember when Steve Jobs released the first iPhone June 29, 2007, I sure do and it changed the landscape of mobile devices.
2. During his unveiling, he released a phone that would use the mobile browser to provide applications.
3. While this didn't pan out - due to hardware, web, and mobile network limitations, the time is now for web applications.
4. PWAs are an amalgam of mobile and web apps that you can access outside of curated store.
5. They tend to be platform agnostic (meaning they can run on many devices without modification) on any device with a standards compliant web browser - (Chrome being on the primary browsers)
6. PWAs are available on both mobile and desktop.
7. Google released the specifications for progressive web applications (PWAs) in 2015.
8. PWAs are web pages built using common web technologies such as; [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets") and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).
9. In the beginning, web apps required Internet connectivity and were simply a bookmarked web site; now PWAs have become more sophisticated and be installed as a micro application (offloading some resources to the phone and then using the online connectivity to provide backing services or data.
10. Over time, PWAs have become more capable and even faster than their mobile application counterparts and the number of apps are growing.
11. Because they primarily live online, PWAs are always up to date with features, contain the security updates, and in some cases can conserve data versus their web counterpart since portions of the application are downloaded once but used many times (which can also lead to faster load times).
12. You can install PWAs on your home screen or launcher and because each PWA is in a separate window, you can use Chrome OS's window's manager to its fullest extent.

### Install PWAs

1. Google has released a ton of PWAs in the past couple of months and I've been installing them on my Chrome OS devices wherever I can find them.
2. Here's how you install them on Chrome OS:

    * Using the Chrome browser, visit a site know to have PWA alternative (more on finding these later)
    * On the right side of the address bar, to the left of the *bookmark this tab* (☆) option an *Install {Application}* option (⊕) as shown in the image below:

    ![Install option in Chrome browser](/images/posts/2020-04-29-progressive-web-apps/install-pwa.pnglink)

	  * Click *Install* in notification as shown in the image below:

    ![Verify the installation](/images/posts/2020-04-29-progressive-web-apps/pwa-install-verification.pnglink)

	  * Chrome OS will install the web app, place an item in the Launcher, and display the app in it's own unique window as shown below (if you were logged into the web application, the credentials will most likely move to the PWA so you don't have to log back in)

	![Twitter PWA on Chrome OS](/images/posts/2020-04-29-progressive-web-apps/twitter-pwa.pnglink)

    * Most PWAs will mimic their web or mobile application almost exactly and to load the PWA, simply visit the Launcher (you can pin the app to the Shelf), or use the search button and type the name of the PWA.

3. It's that easy. No visit to the Web store and as I stated, the apps are always up to date.
4. Remove PWAs the same way you remove other applications; usually a right-click and then select _Remove_ on Chrome OS or drag to the Android icon _Uninstall_ option on Android.

### How to find PWAs
