I'm on the road this week and had some time to pull over and share the announcements from Google I/O 2019. More sharing than telling, this ad hoc episode was recorded in a noisy hotel room with my portable recording gear. We will return to the [Linux on Chrome OS](/0021) series (and a decent recording studio) next week. I hope you enjoy this brief interlude.

No show notes for this episode but check out the [Google I/O 2019 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQSaPsKHPqs) and then take a listen to the my commentary.
