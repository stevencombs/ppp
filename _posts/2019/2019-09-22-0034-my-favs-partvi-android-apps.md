The sixth and final in my six-part series of My Favs episodes. In this episode, I share my favorite Android apps for the Pixel Phone. These are the applications I have installed on my Pixel Phone. Since this episode could be a "snoozer", I keep it lively and share tips and tricks for each app. In the Addendum, I share a first for me and some additional pixel-powered tips and news.

## Show Notes

### Introduction

1. Welcome to episode 0034 and part VI of my six part series on "My Favs." This episode, my favorite Android apps.
2.This could be the most boring episode ever since Android apps are very personal selections and I only install applications I use on a regular basis.
3. I'll share some tips for or highlights for each app to keep it interesting.
4. Your job is to share your favorite apps by commenting on the show post at Reddit.

### Favorite Android Apps

1. I discuss each Android App installed on my Pixel 3 XL.
2. In episode 0029 I shared my favorite Android apps for Chrome OS; these are a bit different.
3. Remember, I'm cheap, err frugal, so I rarely spend money on apps.
4. I'm not a game player.

### My Pixel 3 XL Launcher Configuration

Below is an screencast I created so you could see my Pixel phone launcher configuration. No widgets or folder for me. Only the most used apps on my home screen. What's yours look like? Take a screen shot or create an animated GIF and share on the [Pixel Power Podcast subreddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelpowerpodcast/).

### Addendum

1. Extensions list from Belgium listener and Reddit user, [u/srfwx](https://www.reddit.com/user/srfwx/).  See the list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelpowerpodcast/comments/d1igyl/0033_my_favs_part_v_chrome_browser_extensions/). Love that folks are now sharing. Learning so much more. Come join us!
2. Pixel 4 release on October 15th. Probably a Black Friday purchase so I can bring you updates. Consider supporting me to help off set costs (see show notes page above). Pixel 3 XL will go to my wife and I'll take her Moto X4 to replace Nexus 6 with Google Fi SIM for runs.
3. Android Auto: Google is asking for another log from my phone (right after I plug in phone to car). Listener Mitchell confirms he is having same problem on his Pixel 3 (not his OG or 2). Hopefully not a hardware issue. Check out the image he sent me on the right.
4. Table full of Pixel Users while visiting my daughter in Chicago (tech support ensued).
5. Colleague at worked asked my advice on purchase of used or refurbished OG Pixel phone. I referred her to the [Pixel 3a](https://amzn.to/2Ffo8Kh).
6. New [Wyze Cam Plugs](https://amzn.to/2ZDuaxp) arrived with a surprise support sticker inside.
