In Episode 0009 (2019-01-13), I take a short detour from our two-part Google Keep series and look a week full of Google-related news. The Consumer Electronics Show was last week and not only was there a host of Google-assisted products released, but Google also released some significant enhancements to their services. I run down the very long list.
