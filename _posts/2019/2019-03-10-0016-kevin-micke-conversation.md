In part two, of a three-part series on getting things done (GTD), I have a conversation with Kevin Micke, creator of [GTaskD](https://www.gtaskd.com/); a new web front end for Google Tasks. Before our conversation though, I share a few observations and tips in the Addendum segment and end the show with the latest Pixel-related news. A special Pixel Powered thanks to Kevin for taking the time on 2019-03-09 to record.
