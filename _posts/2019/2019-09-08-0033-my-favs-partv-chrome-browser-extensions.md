The fifth and penultimate in a six-part series of episodes I'm calling, My Favs. In this episode, I share my favorite Chrome browser extensions. These are the extensions installed and synced across all my Chrome browser devices but a few of them really add to your Pixelbook, Slate or Chrome OS device experience.

In the Addendum I answer a listener question, share some additional flags, clear up some mistakes and then share some family news. It's a jammed packed episode!

### Addendum
1. Android 10 was released for Pixel Phones. I talk all about Android 10 in episode [0027](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com/0027).
2. New [/r/pixelpowerpodcast](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelpowerpodcast) Subreddit for us to communicate and share. Even includes a [Chat Room](https://www.reddit.com/chat/r/pixelpowerpodcast/channel/17196837_cd16c41b6debba747dd39dd8192cd88b166f9e0e).
3. I have a few new flags to share from the [last episode](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com/0032): In addition to Show previews of running apps when hovering over the shelf (`#shelf-hover-previews`); try Tab Hover Cards (#tab-hover-cards) and Tab Hover Card Images (`#tab-hover-card-images`). Use the Show a smaller, denser shelf in laptop mode flag (`#shelf-dense-clamshell`) to reduce the size of the shelf icons when in laptop mode.
4. Keyboard shortcuts are now available for Desks on Chrome OS beta 77:
   1. `SEARCH` + `[` or `]` to move between desks
   2. `SEARCH` + `SHIFT` + `=` to add a desk / `SEARCH` + `SHIFT` + `–` to remove a desk
   3. `SEARCH` + `SHIFT` + `[` or `]` to move a window to the next desk
5. Listener Maxime wanted to know about using the Keyboard cover in tablet mode with the Pixel Slate. Read our interaction and see image [here](https://www.facebook.com/pixelpowerpodcast/posts/391233741773553).
6. Need to capture a list of all Android apps installed on your device, use [List My Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.onyxbits.listmyapps). Save to text file or Markdown along with several other options.
7. I broke down and bought a [Tile 4 pack](https://amzn.to/368u0Ri) this past week.
