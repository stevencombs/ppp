Show synopsis

I take a half-time break in the six-part series of "My Favs" to share my thoughts on the Google Pixel Slate (m3). Regular listeners know I use a Google Pixelbook (i5) almost daily; however, for the past three weeks, I've used a new Pixel Slate exclusively. In this short episode, I share my thoughts.

No addendum this week, but that segment will return in [the next episode](/0032) as I continue to chronicle my pixel-powered life.

### Thoughts on Pixel Slate

* First off, I'm really disappointed the Pixel Slate is a dead product and won't be developed further
* The Slate has been an eye-raiser by colleagues (confusion about whether its an iPad or a Surface)
* The Pixel Slate is the best (only) Chrome OS tablet I've ever used and the second best Chrome OS laptop I've used, and that's the problem
* The Pixel Slate can't quite figure out what it is or wants to be when it grows up
* You can't fold back the Google keyboard and use, you have to remove it from the magnetic connector for it to enter tablet mode (unlike the Pixelbook)
* They both perform identically in my day-to-day use tests (differences between m3 and i5 not noticeable)
* The camera's on the Slate are far superior to the Pixelbook and for video chatting, you will notice those improvements
* The Slates screen is noticeably better than the Pixelbook
* The Slate sound is far superior than the PIxelbook
* The magnetic non-charging/Bluetooth/backlit keyboard/touchpad is brilliant
* I like that I can remove the keyboard and use the Pixel Slate as a tablet, the problem is, I'm not sure I will do this often since the Slate is so big and heavy (the same problem with the new 12" iPad Pro)
* I prefer the Pixel Slate keyboard and like that it protects both the front and the back of the Slate when closed; however, it sometimes feels as if the Slate is going to fall out of the keyboard (I'm sure it won't, but it does cause me to pause sometimes)

### Should you purchase a Pixel Slate?

* Remember there won't be a version two.
* If you want a device that can serve as a tablet and laptop, this might work for you
* If you think it will be the best Chrome OS laptop, it will not, so you should stick to the Pixelbook
* If I was stuck on an island and could only pick one device, I would go with the Slate for it's pure technical superiority and convertible nature
* It boasts a better screen, sound, and keyboard
* I'll continue to bounce between the two devices, but see myself traveling with the Slate primarily
* And that's the wonderful thing about our Chrome OS devices, we have the same apps and data on whichever device we use making this transition seamless!
