You hear it everywhere you go; _Getting things done_! In part-one of a three part series, I discuss the readily available, and free, tools: [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) and Google Tasks, and how you can use these apps to organize your personal and professional life. I begin the episode by sharing my things done (GTD) process and then I end with the news that interests me this week.
