It's Halloween and in this episode I share my new Treat (or is that Trick?); the new Pixel 4 XL (I don't have a Pixel 4, so I can't comment on that scary battery life controversy). Afterward, I have a whole lot to share in the Addendum segment including my new nickname, the deal I received on my Pixel 4 XL, and another Pixel related purchase I'm looking forward to receiving in November. ðŸ‘»ðŸŽƒâš°

## Show Notes

### Welcome

* I'm your host, Mr. Toasty Toes (more on my new nickname in the addendum)
* Everyone has Pixel 4 fever â€“ well, at least three of us at the college
* I was going to wait until Black Friday to purchase my Pixel 4 but my mind was changed because I received quite the deal on my Pixel 4 XL (more in the addendum)
* Ad-hoc episode last time to cover the Made by Google 2019 event and some missed [my episode on Gboard](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com/0035) and some great tips to get the most out of this virtual keyboard application

### Pixel 4 XL Review

I will do my best to focus on my thoughts on the phone and not Android 10 (see [episode 0027](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com/0027).

#### Design

* I chose white (orange was never an option), but with my case, you can't tell (more later on the case)
* Square camera bump with two cameras, flash, and a sensor
* Almost exactly the same size as the 3 XL as is the screen without notch
* Power button is softer than Pixel 3 XL and taking time for me to get use to double-click to launch camera
* Volume up/down
* No finger printer reader (no notification swiping)
* No headphone jack - I've already adjusted and really like the USB-C buds
* Notchless design with a big forehead that you quickly forget about and I'm over the notch and the chin discussion

#### Hardware

* USB-C connection
* Does NOT include USB-C headset (bummer) - for the price, it should
* Includes USB-C charger and transfer cable (took me about 2 mins to transfer data from 3â†’4 and about 5 more to download apps and updates)
* Thanks to eSIM, [Google Fi](https://g.co/fi/r/07H30X) service transfer from Pixel 3 to 4 was quick and easy (although there is a physical SIM slot with dual SIM support coming later)
* Stereo speakers have good sound for vocal audio, fair to good for music, and great for movies (depth)
* Three microphones for Google Assistant, phone, Duo, and other applications are working well for pick up and Google assistant

#### Processor and Memory

* I chose the 64 Gb model (I still had space left over on my 64 Gb Pixel 3 XL)
* QualcommÂ® Snapdragon 855â„¢ octo-core - snappy and no lag yet (time will tell with Android OS)
* Titan M Security Module - adding extra security to OS and Face Unlock
* Pixel Neural Core for AI powered image manipulation - more camera time needed to really see how this is working
* Adreno 640 handles the graphic processing - FAST and can't wait to tryout some games

#### Battery

* Pixel 4 got slammed in reviews for battery life (I can't vouch for those reviews)
* Pixel 4 XL is excellent and better than my year old 3 XL (so an upgrade from my now one-year old battery) - I usually have 75%+ after lunch
* I never leave my phone to charge overnight and try to top it off when I know I can remove it from charger

#### Screen

* Amazing 6.3" QHD+ AMOLED at a whopping 537 pixels per inch (ppi)
* No notch and I'm okay with that
* 90 Hz screen really ads to the fluidity of the swipes and scrolls
* HDR support for online video viewing
* Bright enough (no issues outside for me in regular use)
* Gorilla Glass 5 - I've heard some screen protectors are messing up motion sense and face unlock because they cover the forehead hardware, which is why I use a folio case (more later)

#### Camera

* Zoom up to 8x works really well (remember to not crop to zoom after shot, use pinch to zoom and click the shutter)
* Unlimited photo storage for high resolution (not original RAW)
* I've not had the time or the opportunity to really try out the camera, may be more in future episodes - initial photos seem great

#### Face Unlock

* Quick setup (move your head around the camera as directed)
* Bypasses the lock screen
* Amazing recognition speed - lifting phone turns on cameras
* LastPass now works (in beta) - it appears if you select LastPass, you no longer have access to Android login (still researching)
* Controversy around eye closed (maybe you shouldn't sleep around people you don't trust?)
* Check out the settings to tailor your experience

#### Motion Sense

* Minimal number of "Quick Gestures" that include music navigation and phone silence for calls and alarms
* Hopefully future updates will bring additional features such as gesture to show notifications and scrolling through documents (great suggestions from reddit user buckozdude)
* Is Google preparing us for a future without a touch screen and purely gesture UI?

#### Google Assistant

* Voice activated, swipe from corner (Android 10), or squeeze the sides
* Just seems faster and more responsive due to more on device processing for requests that don't require connectivity
* New colorful integrated design (not a pop-up card) - there's talk that this is not available when phone is connected to G Suites account, but is working for my educational account
* Car accident detection - lets hope I never get to check this, but make sure to activate in settings

#### Recorder App

* Transcription is spot on and accurate (had fun with a co-worker trying it out)
* Show's a general waveform tied to transcription
* Transcription words are highlighted as you listen to recording
* Search the text of a bunch of recordings to find the one you need

#### Android Auto

* I have Android Auto again and it works better on the Pixel 4 XL than it ever did on the 3 XL
* More responsive and it's been so long since I used it, there have been some improvements
* Better Google Assistant recognition and response time

#### Miscellaneous

* Comes with three months of Google One with tech support and 100 Gb storage

#### Case

* [Feitenn Google Pixel 4 XL Wallet Case](https://amzn.to/2t7JGpi)($10.00) â€“ I purchased gray, but there are many colors available
* Protects screen when closed
* Protect camera bump from scratches
* Image at the top of the show notes

#### Reddit Comments

* I asked the [Pixel Power Podcast Reddit](http://reddit.pixelpowerpodcast.com/) community for some thoughts

#### Final Thoughts

* I didn't _need_ a new phone
* If I wasn't doing this podcast, I might have waited another year
* Upgrading my wife to a Pixel 3 XL helped my decision
* If you have a Pixel 3, XL, or a, I would recommend you wait one more year
* The Pixel 4 XL is going to serve me well
* Phone is evolutionary, not revolutionary
* I believe we will see more revolutionary features come via software and many of them may be exclusive to the 4
* Is it me, or can you always tell when an iPhone user reviews a Pixel device?

### Addendum

1. I mentioned this episode would be 0036 â€“ It is not, it is 0037 (changed because I'd forgotten I now include ad hoc episodes in the number count.
2. While discussing Pixel Buds 2 I could not remember the name of Apple's Bluetooth headphones. It's Apple Airpods, of course!
3. **The big deal:** $100 with Google Fi promotion and an extra $150 with long time subscriber reward brings the cost of the Pixel 4 XL to $649!!! First order was for 4 then after reviews about battery, changed to 4 XL.
4. Pre-ordered Google Stadia Founders Edition while trying to decide on whether I would purchase the Pixel 4. Arrives November 7th and I snuck in.
5. New special offers, check them out now (Duet Display and Photolemur).
6. I mentioned a flag was causing Pixel Slate reboots â€“ turns out it wasn't the flag and a powerwash cleared it up for me.
7. Made by Google Twitter responded to a recent tweet regarding unlimited storage of Pixel phone photos (see embed at the right).
8. It's Halloween season, read [my latest blog post](https://www.stevencombs.com/gadgets/2019/10/19/the-auking-lcd-projector.html) to learn how I used a $50 LCD projector to scare the Trick 'r Treaters.
9. Also for Halloween, let's revisit the [Google Graveyard - Killed by Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/).
10. **About that nickname:** I'm a level 7 local guide and this week I received my local guide socks â€“ user radiantwave has given me the new nickname of Mr. Toasty Toes!
11. Commodore 64 program found on a 1980's Christian rock album.
