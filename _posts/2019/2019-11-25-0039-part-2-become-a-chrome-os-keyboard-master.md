In the second and last part Turkey Day edition of the two-part series, I spend less time than normal talking about extensions and utilities you can install that power up your Chrome OS keyboard ninja skills. In the addendum, we ramp up for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. Happy Thanksgiving to all my United States listeners! ðŸ¦ƒ
