In this recording, and just in time for your commute home, I share my ramblings and musings from the 2019 Made by Google event. As a reminder, ad hoc episodes don't include show notes, aren't prepared, and receive minimal editing. In other words, they may have errors an inaccuracies. Don't worry though; I'll clean errors up in [the next episodes's](/0037) addendum.
