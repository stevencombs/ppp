In the first two episodes of the four-part series, we learned how to get started with Linux on Chrome OS. In this episode I share how to access files and hardware devices in the VM as well as how to make those pesky applications visible on the high resolution Pixelbook screens. Thereâ€™s also show format changes based on listener feedback and a new way to interact with the podcast.
