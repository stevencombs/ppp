The first in a new six-part series of episodes I'm calling, _My Favs_. In the first episode of this six part series, I share my favorite Chrome OS applications. These are apps that are the first to be installed (or restored) on my Pixelbook (and Chromebook). Because I install these apps on my Pixelbook, they follow me around on Chrome browser installs on other desktop computers such as Mac and Linux. In the Addendum segment, I share listener feedback and questions as well as talk about a new device I am excited to try.
