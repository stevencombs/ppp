The Android keyboard is the most important user interface for your Pixel phone and your productivity. In this episode I talk about the default Pixel keyboard, Gboard. After listening you will learn all the tips, tricks, and settings that will help you get the most out of typing on the Google Pixel. Afterward in the Addendum, I make a few shopping recommendations and briefly share my visit with my 106 year-young aunt!
