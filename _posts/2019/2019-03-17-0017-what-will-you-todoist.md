In this episode, I end my three-part series on getting things done (GTD) by sharing my favorite task and project management application; Todoist. I share a complete look at the application on multiple devices, and throughout the episode, I share tips on how to get the most out of this productivity powerhouse. As always, I open with "The Addendum" and close with the latest news; and there are some fun and big news items this week!
