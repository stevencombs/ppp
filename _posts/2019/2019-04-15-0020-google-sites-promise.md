Promised way back in [episode 0001](0001), I finally provide my thoughts on the use of Google Sites and how you can create a free online presence. As always, I share some interesting items from the past week in the Addendum segment and then end of the show with the latest Google related news and at the beginning of the show I opine about some related tech topics.
