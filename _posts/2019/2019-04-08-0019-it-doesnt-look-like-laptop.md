In this episode I share how to relax with your Pixelbook, or any other convertible Chromebook, and use the device in one of four unique configurations: laptop, tent, stand or tablet. I then explore Chrome OSâ€™s unique tablet mode functions and teach you a few things you may not have known. The episode wraps with a look at two weeks of news after a tax hiatus week off (and an illness).
