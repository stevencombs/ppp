I'm on the road and took some time to use the mobile recording equipment to crank out an episode of observations and news.

Hear me talk about my travel experiences with my old Nexus 6 (complete with Google Fi SIM card). Listen as I ramble and complain about the recording setup. Enjoy as I share a whole host of other observations and news revealed during the week of interest to all Pixelbook and Pixel phone users. Finally, hear me take a drink of water.

Exciting stuff indeed! If you listen closely, you will also hear a few tips and tricks.
