The previous four episodes of the podcast focused on Linux on Chrome OS with our Pixelbooks. Not to be outdone, the Pixel phone gets a Terminal via an app called Termux. Learn all about using Termux and how having a Terminal on our phone is not only geeky, but can be useful as well. In this weekâ€™s addendum, I spend some time sharing some quick news and my new hobby. And, I finally get an episode back under the 30 minute mark!
