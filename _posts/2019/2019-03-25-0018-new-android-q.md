For this episode, I've scoured the web looking for what's new in the beta release of Android Q, the next OS coming soon to Pixel Phones (and possibly Pixelbooks). And for this week’s “The Addendum”, I discovered a few useful tips I just had to share and ponder if anyone at Google actually listens to this podcast. Best guess? Probably not. And let’s not forget our weekly news.
