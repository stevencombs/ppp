## Show Notes

### Introduction

Welcome to 2020 and a new version of the Pixel Power Podcast. So what's new?

1. The only resolution I've ever kept was my resolution to not have a resolution.
2. New 20 minute format to keep things brief and concise.
3. Around 10 minutes for a topic where you learn how to get the most out of your Pixel or Google device and another 10 mintues in the addendum.
4. New website (moved and am still moving all old posts to new Jekyll platform from Google Sites).
5. Shownotes now available at https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com/XXXX or 0041 for this episode.
6. A note about ads: I use the revenue to support the hobby and I'm okay if you use an [ad-blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg), this is my favorite, but I do hope you will disable on my page so I can bring you even more pixel-powered podcasts. I am making adjustments to make them less onerous.
7. Hoping to add more multimedia features such as screencasts.
8. May even live stream on YouTube when I get up the courage to do so.
