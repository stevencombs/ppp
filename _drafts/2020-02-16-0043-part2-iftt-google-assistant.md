## Show Notes

### Introduction

Last time we learned how to use IFTTT with out Pixel Phone. Today we talk about using IFTT with the Google Assistant available on a plethora of devices. 

Reminder about IFTTT:

1. Cloud service used to automate actions.
2. Create applets from various services.
3. It's free for consumers.
4. Only drawback is the lack of complex applets.
5. Numerous devices and services offered.

You create applets from triggers and actions or select from a huge library of applets created and shared by other users. You should browse the library just to see what's possible and generate ideas for your own applets. We'll take a look at some toward the end of this segment.

### IFTTT Google Assistant services

IFTTT includes four services specific to the Google Assistant as shown in the image below:

In order for these services to work with phone or tablet actions, install the [IFTTT app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt&hl=en_US) from the Google Play Store.

Only offers services triggers for Google Assistant.
