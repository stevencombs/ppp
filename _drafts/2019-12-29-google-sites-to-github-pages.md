Over the Christmas break, I decided to move the podcast web page from Google Sites to GitHub pages. It turned out to be a much larger task than I originally anticipated. There were many tasks that I needed to complete and I decided to capture the list of tasks in this blog post.

This is not a step-by-step on how to move a site from one platform to another, but simply a documentation of my process and some of the challenges I found along the way.

## Equipment and applications
Before I list the steps used to make the conversion, I want to share the many devices I used during the process. I think many readers will be shocked at my "scattered flow."

### Lenovo i5

  * **Ubuntu Mate** - By far my favorite Linux Distro
  * **Atom** - Open source editor. By itself Atom is an awesome tool, but when you add packages, you can customize Atom to become an amazing blogging tool.
  * **Chrome Browser** - This is the Pixel Power Podcast, of course I use this browser and install it on all my devices to keep things synced.
  * **Google Photos** - I do all my image editing within Google Photos. I don't really have a need to do more than this tool provides.
  * **Google Suite** - Where I create show notes, episode show art, and any other media needed for the podcast. Having all these tools and files in the cloud ensure I have access to everything, everywhere, on any device.
  * **Jekyll** - GitHub Pages hosts this blog using static pages that are rendered when uploaded. If you want to preview on a local machine before you commit to the live server, you can install Jekyll on your computer and preview all changes. This wasn't the smoothest process for me, but I did finally get it working.

### Mac mini i3

  * **Atom** - I use a sync-settings package to ensure all devices have the same packages and settings.
  * Chrome Browser
  * Google Photos
  * Google Suite
  * Jekyll
  * GitHub Desktop

### Pixelbook i5

  * Debian Linux - Needed for Atom.
  * Atom - How cool is it that I can run Atom on all platforms?
  * Google Photos
  * Google Suite
