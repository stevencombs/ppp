## Flatpak Application Manager

I've used every application manage for Crostini:

1. Apt - the default application manage for Debian (Crostini)
2. Snap -
3. AppImage - Download, update permissions, and run from the Terminal
4. Install from script - See Arduino on Chrome OS

But Flatpak is my new favorite for the following reasons:

1. Most up to date applicatins
2. Most popular Linux applications
2. Excellent variety of applications
2. Easy to update applications
3. Easy to locate applications (online and in the Flatpak command line)

### Install Flatpak for Crostini

Time to open the Terminal (you do have Linux Beta switch flipped?) and enter the following commands:

1. Launch the _Terminal_.
2. At the prompt, type the following to install flatpak:

    `sudo apt install flatpak`

3. At the prompt, type the following to add the Flathub repository:

    `flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`

4. At the prompt, type the following to add a password to your user account for superuser access (if you've not already done so.):

    `sudo passwd <username>`

> TIP: Use the `whoami` command to determine your username.

Flatpak is now installed and you can use it to install applications. Before we install applications, let's see what's available.

### Search for Applications on Flathub

The best place to see if Flatpak is for you is to search [Flathub](https://www.flathub.org).

### Install Applications


Icon is automatically added to the _Launcher_.


### List, Update, and Remove Applications

Time to open our Terminal again

### Caveats

Like all Crostini software, some work well and others still have UI issues.
