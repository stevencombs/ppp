The fifth and penultimate in a six-part series of episodes I'm calling, My Favs. In this episode, I share my favorite Chrome browser extensions. These are the extensions installed and synced across all my Chrome browser devices but a few of them really add to your Pixelbook, Slate or Chrome OS device experience.

In the Addendum I answer a listener question, share some additional flags, clear up some mistakes and then share some family news. It's a jammed packed episode!

## Show Notes

### Introduction

1. Welcome to episode 0033 and part V (and the penultimate episode) of my six part series on "My Favs." This episode, my favorite Chrome browser extensions.
Thanks to new listener Maxime from Québec, Canada (questions asked covered in the Addendum segment).
2. Things are bit different in the show notes this week. Not a Google Doc but on the main show notes page and hopefully more discoverable.

### Favorite Chrome Browser Extensions
I discuss each of the Chrome browser extensions below during the show and even pop in a few tips and tricks to help you get more out of the extensions. These are the extensions installed and synced across all my devices

Quick word about extension management. A bunch of extensions can take up your entire toolbar. Use the Hide in Chrome Menu option to clean up icons that work in the background or you use less frequently.

### Addendum
1. Android 10 was released for Pixel Phones. I talk all about Android 10 in episode [0027](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com/0027).
2. New [/r/pixelpowerpodcast](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelpowerpodcast) Subreddit for us to communicate and share. Even includes a [Chat Room](https://www.reddit.com/chat/r/pixelpowerpodcast/channel/17196837_cd16c41b6debba747dd39dd8192cd88b166f9e0e).
3. I have a few new flags to share from the [last episode](https://www.pixelpowerpodcast.com/0032): In addition to Show previews of running apps when hovering over the shelf (`#shelf-hover-previews`); try Tab Hover Cards (#tab-hover-cards) and Tab Hover Card Images (`#tab-hover-card-images`). Use the Show a smaller, denser shelf in laptop mode flag (`#shelf-dense-clamshell`) to reduce the size of the shelf icons when in laptop mode.
4. Keyboard shortcuts are now available for Desks on Chrome OS beta 77: `SEARCH` + `[` or `]` to move between desks | `SEARCH` + `SHIFT` + `=` to add a desk | `SEARCH` + `SHIFT` + `–` to remove a desk | `SEARCH` + `SHIFT` + `[` or `]` to move a window to the next desk.
5. Listener Maxime wanted to know about using the Keyboard cover in tablet mode with the Pixel Slate. Read our interaction and see image [here](https://www.facebook.com/pixelpowerpodcast/posts/391233741773553).
6. Need to capture a list of all Android apps installed on your device, use [List My Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.onyxbits.listmyapps). Save to text file or Markdown along with several other options.
7. I broke down and bought a [Tile 4 pack](https://amzn.to/368u0Ri) this past week.
8. Super excited. My Daughter just switched from an iPhone to a [Pixel 3](https://amzn.to/2u2LUGN) (she didn't want to wait for 4 and got a great deal).
9. Android Auto issue reported and received very strange response.
