Show synopsis

I take a half-time break in the six-part series of "My Favs" to share my thoughts on the Google Pixel Slate (m3). Regular listeners know I use a Google Pixelbook (i5) almost daily; however, for the past three weeks, I've used a new Pixel Slate exclusively. In this short episode, I share my thoughts.

No addendum this week, but that segment will return in [the next episode](/0032) as I continue to chronicle my pixel-powered life.
