## Main Topic

During COVID-19 I've been hit by the creation bug in both imaging and video. While I've always created images for the podcast, such as show art, promotional art, and web site design, I've also been experimenting with YouTube.

What many may not know is that I create every piece of original artwork for my blog, YouTube videos, or this podcast in Google Slides. Google Slides? Why not Google Drawings? I'll cover that as well as the tips and tricks I've learned along the way. Whether you are a seasoned or new user of Google Slides, I think you find some tips in this podcast. Let's dig in.

### Using Google Slides Instead of Google Drawings



### Setting up Google Slides



### Setting up the Background



### Using the Tools



### Export Options
